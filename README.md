Bond Portfolio Risk Management

This is the final project for Computer Simulation and Risk Assessment (a course in my graduate stage)
In this project, I led the team to estimate the Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) of a bond portfolio consisted of two Treasury Inflation Protected securities (TIPS) 

1.	Applied PCA technology to simulate one-day ahead yield curve, based on which calculated the corresponding spot rate 
2.	Forecasted the CPI in the next 5 years using SARIMA method to obtain the adjusted face value of TIPs bonds in each future period
3.	Simulated the VaR and ES of the portfolio one day later with Bootstrap and Monte-Carlo simulation methods
